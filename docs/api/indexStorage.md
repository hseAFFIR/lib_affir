## Single approach
### Overview
The core idea is to store the index in a single file.
```mermaid
graph TD
A[Input: BigToken] -->|Check indexMap| B{Exists in indexMap?}
B -->|No| C[Find a new block]
C --> D[Append new positions to the storage]

B -->|Yes| E{Is the mask size sufficient?}
E -->|Yes| D
E -->|No| F[Free the current block]
F --> G[Find a new block for the larger mask]
G --> H[Copy existing positions\nto the new block location]
H --> D
```

### Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- Working with a single file â†’ no significant delays from opening multiple files

**Cons:**
- File compression complexity. Frequent index updates create empty blocks
that need to be tracked and compressed.

### Implementation
Two files are created:
1. Index metadata
2. The index itself

#### Metadata file
Describes the index file.
Consists of two hash tables:
1. A map <blockStart, blockCount> that stores the starting position of free space 
and its size in base blocks (16 tokens per block).
2. A map `<token_body, (blockMask, blockStart, bytesSize)>`:
   - `blockMask`: Determines the block size. Blocks can have different lengths to efficiently 
store tokens of varying frequency.
   - `blockStart`: Marks the starting position (in base blocks) 
of a free space segment of size blockMask.

#### Index file
A byte-encoded file storing triples `(uint_32, uint_32, uint_32)` representing (fileId, pos, posWord).
If an index block exceeds its allocated space during an update, it expands to the next block size.
